# Forem data sources

The examples in this folder show how to use the available `forem_*` datasources.

The file [terraform.tfvars.template](./terraform.tfvars.template) contains templated values for the variables that you need to provide. Copy it to a new file, populate it with your values and execute `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` with the `-var` option.
